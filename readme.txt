Matram.io is a WordPress updates monitoring service. For each update in your WP site, get a side-by-side comparison of before-and-after screenshots.

== Description ==

[Matram.io](http://matram.io "WordPress Updates Monitoring") gives you a real-time screenshot of your WordPress site after each update that you can compare with a recent screenshot before the update was applied. Apart from this, a screenshot of your website is taken every 4 hours so that you can compare them any time you want.

1. Upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the Matram.io plugin
3. If you do not have a Matram.io account, you can create one here - [http://app.matram.io/wp-login.php?action=register](http://app.matram.io/wp-login.php?action=register)
4. After logging into your Matram.io account, click on the Add Site button and add your Wordpress site's home page link and any additional pages you want to monitor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Matram.io work, technically? =

The Matram.io plugin listens for update calls and after an update is applied, a call is made to our server to grab a shot of your website. We then send you an email with a link to the screenshot comparison.

= Can I add more than one link to monitor? =

Yes. You can add upto 5 links to be monitored (1 home page link + 4 more links)
